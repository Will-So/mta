**Our Problem**:

    The client has stated that they want to "harness the power of data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of [their] street team" in order "to fill [their] event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach."

    "To this end [they] place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to [their] gala.""

    Based on the data at our disposal, we feel that subway exits is the most useful metric towards this end, as it is likelier  people will stop and give their email addresses on their way out, rather than when trying to catch a train.

    We will attempt to optimize by any or all of the following criteria: station, train-line, time of day, time of week, time of the year (as it relates to the summer gala).  

    By making our data easily sortable by the above factors, we will then explore combining this data with socio-economic data from a second source, and hopefully we will be able to overlay our results on top of a NYC subway map.
